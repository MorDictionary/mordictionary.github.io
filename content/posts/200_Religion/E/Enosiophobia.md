## Example Sentences
- Listening to **LE SSERAFIM’s** *“Unforgiven”* felt like an act of rebellion against *enosiophobia* itself — a refusal to live chained by shame, and a reminder that self-worth need not depend on human absolution.  
- In contrast, **Robert Rule**, a Christian father who forgave his daughter’s murderer — the *Green River Killer* — embodied the antidote to *enosiophobia*: the conviction that no sin lies beyond Christ’s forgiveness, that even the tax collector and the prostitute may be redeemed if they come to Him in repentance.

---

## Etymology
From Greek *enosis* (“sin” or “fault”) + *-phobia* (“fear”).

---

## Concept Note
*Enosiophobia* captures the human dread of being unforgivable — a fear transcended either through rebellion against judgment (*“Unforgiven”*) or through grace that redeems even the gravest wrongs (*Christ’s command to forgive all*).
